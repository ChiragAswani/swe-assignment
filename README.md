## Assignment
Please write a lightweight full-stack application that is dockerized from a React and Node.js application
for note-taking that creates a note, deletes a note, views all notes, and searches for a specific note.
Feel free to use any data source (relational, non-relational database, in-memory datastructure, etc.). 
For authentication, let's allow users to create a username and password or log in if they already have an account to perform these actions only on their own notes.

1. note_title     | Alphabets only - maximum 30 characters
2. note_content   | Alphanumeric field - maximum 1000 characters
```
